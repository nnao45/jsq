# Manual Test for REPL Issue

To test the REPL issue, please run the following commands manually in your terminal:

1. First, build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the REPL with test data:
```bash
echo '{"test": "data"}' | npx jsq
```

3. In the REPL, type the following command:

```
> $.aaaaaaaaaaa
```

## Current behavior (PROBLEM):
- When typing `$.aaaaaaaaaaa` (non-existent property), it returns the entire data object: `{ "test": "data" }`

## Expected behavior:
- Should return `undefined` because the property doesn't exist

## Note:
The fix has been implemented to always pass `undefined` as the `lastResult` parameter to the evaluator, which prevents previous results from being carried over between evaluations.
